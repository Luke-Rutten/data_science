Or [which celebrity would secretly hate you](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahwainschel/celebrity-feud-quiz)? Or even [the Taylor Swift song that best fits your personality](https://www.buzzfeed.com/goveganallanimalsfeel/which-taylor-swift-song-are-you-quiz)? \n\nWell over at Buzzfeed, you have the ability to find out! Each of these quizzes take the answers you enter, make some kind of inference about who you are, and then give you a result based on that. Their goal is to assess your personality, then match it to one of the quizzes' predetermined options. Sounds pretty cool, right?\n\nUnfortunately, under the hood, it's not so glamorous. For every quiz question, the available answers are connected to one of the potential outcomes. Every answer you choose contributes one point to the outcome its associated with. At the end of the quiz, whichever outcome has the most points is selected as your best match.\n\nThat's lame.\n\nI mean, come on. Basic counting? Personality is so much more nuanced than that.\n\nNow, to be clear, this approach accomplishes Buzzfeed's main goal of easy-to-make-and-take personality quizzes. From a business perspective, it's clearly a good model. But the focus of this post is not business models. It's personality models, and in that realm, multivariate statistics allow us to do so much better.\n\nSo, if our goal here is to actually assess someone's personality and then find the closest match to it, how do we go about doing that?\n\nThere are two implications in that question and we'll need to address both before we arrive at our eventual answer. The assumptions are (1) that personality is something we can quantify and, (2) that, once quantified, we have a way to measure how “close” or “far” one personality is from another.\n\nLet’s address these, one at a time.\n\n# 1) Personality is quantifiable\n\nHow do we turn something abstract, like personality, into something concrete, like numbers?\n\nWe'll go through this section quickly so we can get to the stats that come next. Conveniently for us, scientists have been studying this topic for a while now and the answer the field has settled on is that we can reliably piece apart a personality into just five different traits. We assign a score for each trait and then view the unique combination of those scores as someone’s personality.\n\nThe traits are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, but those details aren’t really important right now. If you'd like learn more, I'd recommend reading [the wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits)!\n\nWhat matters here is that we have a way to represent personality numerically. We ask someone a series of questions, use their answers to arrive at a score on each of the five identified traits (let's put them a 1 - 5 scale for convenience's sake), and then view those scores as a representation of personality. For example, we might get an outcome like:\n\n| Name   | Openness | Consc. | Extrav. | Agree. | Nuerot. |\n|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Reader | 3       | 3     | 3      | 5     | 1      |\n\nThis \"Reader\" would be average in most ways, but very easy to get along with and, emotionally, quite stable. Now, let's compare their personality to a set of others and see if we can figure out which they're closest to. Since I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan, let's see if we can figure out which hobbit they're most like:\n\n![Sam, Frodo, Pippin, and Merry at the Skirmish at Weathertop](four_hobbits.png)\n\n| Name   | Openness | Consc. | Extrav. | Agree. | Neruot. |\n|--------|----------|--------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Reader | 3       | 4     | 2      | 4     | 1      |\n| Frodo  | 3       | 4     | 2      | 4     | 3      |\n| Sam    | 3       | 5     | 3      | 4     | 1      |\n| Merry  | 2       | 4     | 3      | 3     | 1      |\n| Pippin | 4       | 1     | 5      | 5     | 2      |\n\nUnfortunately, there don't appear to be any perfect matches between our reader and the hobbits. So, how do we figure out how apart they are?\n\n# 2) Measuring “Distances” Between Personalities\n\nIf we’d quantified personality using just one number, measuring the distances between them would be easy. We could just subtract one personality number from another, and the closer the result is to “0”, the closer the personalities would be. Instead, however, our personalities consist of five separate dimensions, so we have to compare five separate numbers all at once.\n\nAlternatively, we could take the differences between every trait one by one and then add those differences together to get a \"total\" difference. So, looking at our hobbits example:\n\n| Name   | Openness | Consc. | Extraversion | Agree. | Neruot. |\n|--------|----------|--------|--------------|--------|---------|\n| Reader | 3       | 4     | 2      | 4     | 1      |\n| Frodo  | 3       | 4     | 2      | 4     | 3      |\n| Sam    | 3       | 5     | 3      | 4     | 1      |\n| Merry  | 2       | 4     | 3      | 3     | 1      |\n| Pippin | 4       | 1     | 5      | 5     | 2      |\n\nWe would find that Frodo has a \"summed distance\" of 2 (just two points away on neuroticism from our reader) while Pippin has a \"summed distance\" of 9 (one point away on openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism and three points away on both conscientiousness and extraversion). As Frodo's summed score is smaller, we can say our reader is closer to Frodo than to Pippin.\n\nBut there's a problem with this method—and one that the astute reader may already have noticed. If we apply this logic to all the hobbits, we find that Sam also has a \"summed distance\" score of 2 (one point away on conscientious and on extraversion). Both Frodo and Sam have a \"summed distance\" score of 2, but with distinct ways of reaching that number. Frodo was two points away on one dimension while Sam was one point away on two dimensions.\n\nSo, which is closer?\n\nLucky for us, an insightful mathematician came up with a way to calculate just this sort of thing - [and they did it 4,000 years ago](https://www.britannica.com/science/Pythagorean-theorem)! However, it wasn’t until Pythagorus came along about 1,500 years after that that the technique became widely known: the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n$$\nA^2 + B^2 = C^2\n$$\n\nNow, that’s a formula with mathematical meanings, but I’m going to visualize what's going on here because the visual will help us understand the multivariate statistics that come next. Basically, imagine this: There are two dots on a line. The first one is at point 1 and the second one is at point 5. We can measure between them and say, “Ok, cool, these two dots are 4 points away from each other.”\n\n::: {#fd5b0853 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Load packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotnine as pn\n\n# Create points for graphing\ndat = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1,5], 'y': [1,4]})\n\n# plot data\n(\npn.ggplot(dat, pn.aes(x = 'x', y = 0.02)) +\n  pn.geom_point(size = 5) +\n  pn.annotate(geom = 'segment', x = 1, xend = 5, y = .05, yend = .05, color = 'red', size = 1.5) +\n  pn.annotate(geom = 'segment', x = 1, xend = 1, y = .0513, yend = .03, color = 'red', size = 1.5) +\n  pn.annotate(geom = 'segment', x = 5, xend = 5, y = .0513, yend = .03, color = 'red', size = 1.5) +\n  pn.annotate(geom = 'text', x = 3, y = .065, color = 'red', label = '4 point difference', size = 15) +\n  pn.scale_x_continuous(breaks = range(0, 7), labels = range(0, 7), limits = [0, 6]) +\n  pn.scale_y_continuous(limits = [0, .1]) +\n  pn.theme_classic() +\n  pn.theme(axis_title = pn.element_blank(),\n            axis_text_y = pn.element_blank(),\n            axis_line_y = pn.element_blank(),\n            axis_ticks_y = pn.element_blank(),\n            panel_grid_major = pn.element_blank(),\n            panel_grid_minor = pn.element_blank(),\n            plot_margin = 1,\n            figure_size = (6, 1.7))\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=576 height=163}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut that’s just one dimension. Let's add another. Now, we have one dot at point (1,1) and the next dot at point (5, 4). How far are these two points from each other?\n\n![](grid_1.png)\n\nSimple subtraction doesn't quite work here, so we'll need the Pythagorean theorem to help! It says that the distance between these two points is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of each of the two perpendicular sides. That's a lot of words, but basically it’s just saying that we can figure out how far it is diagonally by looking at how far it is horizontally and vertically, so long as it's formed as a right triangle.\n\n![](grid_2.png)\n\nAlright, great! So that’s how we do it when there’s two dimensions. Now how do we do it when there’s five? Remember, every personality has five scores so we have to do it five times. Thankfully, we can actually extend the Pythagorean formula to as many dimensions as we want! And even if that gets hard to visualize, the math still works.\n\n$$\nA^2 + B^2 + C^2 + D^2 + E^2 = F^2\n$$\n\nThere’s just one, tiny, little issue with this approach and it's that in order for it to work, we need to be able to use right triangles. That means our axes need to intersect at 90 degree angles and *that* means our personality dimensions need to be orthogonal or, in other words, need to be uncorrelated.\n\nUnfortunately, personality dimensions are definitely correlated.\n\nWhy does this matter? Well, imagine that instead of having a graph with two perfectly perpendicular axes, it looked something like this instead:\n\n![](grids_3.png)\n\nHere, as you go up on the X-axis, you’re ALSO starting to go up on the Y-axis: there's a correlation.\n\nThis breaks the Pythagorean theorem. In order for the theorem to work, we need to know the coordinates from perpendicular axes, otherwise we can't make a right triangle. But if our dimensions correlate, our axes aren’t perpendicular.\n\nSo. What can we do?\n\nLuckily, once again, a statistician saves our day. It was back in 1936 that a man by the name P. C. Mahalanobis kept running into this very problem and decided to try and find a way to fix it. What he figured out was that if you know the correlation between two measures, you can correct the axes using that information! To put that in terms of the visual, if we know that the X-axis is being tilted up by 10 degrees, we can just adjust all of our numbers down by 10 degrees to put them back in their proper place.\n\n![](grids_4.png)\n\nIt takes some linear algebra to accomplish, but the important part is this: all we have to do is figure out how much our axes are tilting (or how much they’re correlating) and then we can correct our numbers, allowing us to solve the distance equation once again!\n\nAnd finally we’ve assembled all the pieces we need:\n\n-   A way to put personality into numbers\n-   A way to “un-tilt” correlated axes\n-   A way to calculate distances with our un-tilted axes\n\nAnd with all of that, we can figure out how “close” or “far” your personality is from any other that you can dream up! Then it’s just a matter of finding which distance is the lowest and that’s the one that’s most like you.\n\n",
